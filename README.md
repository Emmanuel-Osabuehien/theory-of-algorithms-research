# Theory Of Algorithms Research

This is a repository which exists to contain the research I used to obtain the knowledge of running juptyer notebooks and also to learn python regarding the areas of computation and computability. Specifically, I learned about the the post correspondence problem, the bounded post correspondence and the countdown numbers game.

These algorithms can be found in the GitHub repostitory: [https://github.com/Emmanuel-Osabuehien/TheoryOfAlgorithmsProject,<br> https://github.com/Emmanuel-Osabuehien/TheoryOfAlgorithmsProject/)

If the link dosen't work than the GitHub repository is set to private.
